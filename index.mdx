## Overview

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a software system that collects, unifies, and organizes customer data from multiple Troura products sources into a single, consistent, and comprehensive profile for each customer. Unlike traditional data warehouses or CRMs, a CDP is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical teams, enabling real-time segmentation, personalization, and data activation across channels.

## Core Concepts

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is built on a set of core concepts that define how customer information is captured, organized, and activated. Understanding these concepts is essential to make the most of the API.

### Profiles

A profile represents a unique customer identity in the CDP. It consolidates attributes such as name, email, document information, and behavioral signals. Profiles are persistent and serve as the foundation of all customer interactions.

### Transactions

A transaction captures an event or interaction associated with a customer. Transactions may include purchases, validations, or other activities relevant to your business. They are time-stamped and linked to profiles and provide a historical view of customer behavior and status changes.

### Decision Variables

Decision variables are dynamic attributes stored within a profile that influence how a customer is segmented or engaged.

### Tags

Tags allow you to categorize and label profiles based on custom criteria, they can represent segments like “VIP Customer”, “At Risk”, or “Engagement Level: High”.

Tags make it easy to filter and group profiles.

### Segments

A segment is a dynamic collection of profiles that share common attributes, decision variables, or tags. Segments are rule-based and continuously updated, making them essential for personalization, targeting, and analytics. They can also be used to trigger actions or to visualize data effectively.
