## Assign tags to a profile

Assigning tags is the primary way to segment and classify users. This section explains how to view the current tags on a profile and how to add or remove them.

### Viewing Existing Tags on a Profile

To understand how a user is currently segmented, you can find all of their assigned tags directly on their profile. This information is centrally located in the contact's profile view.

Navigate to the user's profile and locate the **"Contact information"** section. Within this section, you will see the **"Tags"** field.

* **Tag List:** This area displays all tags associated with the user as visual "pills".
* **Name and Color:** The text in each pill corresponds to the tag's `name` property (e.g., "Hot", "Truorateam"), and the background color is determined by its `color` property.
* **Starting Point:** To modify these tags, click the **"Manage tags"** link located just below the list.

### Adding and Removing Tags

After clicking "Manage tags," a modal window will open. This interface is the control center for modifying a specific user's tags. The main view is the **"Edit tags"** tab.

* **Assigning a Tag:** To add a tag, click on the **"User tags"** input field. A searchable list of all available tags will drop down. Select one or more tags to assign them to the profile.
* **Removing a Tag:** The tags a user already has appear as pills. To remove one, simply click the **(x)** icon located to the right of the tag's name.
* **Saving Changes:** Once you have finished editing, it is **essential** to click the **"Save"** button to apply all modifications. If you close the window without saving, all changes will be lost.
