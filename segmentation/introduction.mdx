description: "Build dynamic segments from profile variables and tags."

Our Customer Data Platform (CDP) currently consolidates user information into detailed profiles and calculates decision variables based on interactions. However, it lacks a dynamic segmentation component that allows grouping users according to specific criteria aligned with client objectives.

Segmentation tools allow business teams to identify target audiences, such as “high-value customers” or “users prone to churn”, and execute automated actions accurately. This supports personalized campaigns and strategic decision-making in an agile manner.

## Rule Structure

Segmentation rules are defined using an extended JSONLogic syntax (also used in the Business Rule Engine). Operators available include:

| Operator | Type       | Description                                        |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| AND      | Logical    | True if all rules in the array are satisfied       |
| OR       | Logical    | True if at least one rule in the array is satisfied|
| NOT      | Logical    | True if the nested rule is not satisfied           |
| =        | Arithmetic | Equal to                                           |
| &gt;     | Arithmetic | Greater than                                       |
| &lt;     | Arithmetic | Less than                                          |
| &gt;=    | Arithmetic | Greater or equal                                   |
| &lt;=    | Arithmetic | Less or equal                                      |

Variables and tags are referenced using:

| Keyword | Description                        |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| VAR     | Refers to a decision variable in the rule |
| TAG     | Refers to a tag in the rule        |

## Nesting Logic

Supports one level of nesting for logical operators.

Allows rules like A AND (B OR C) or A OR (B AND C) but not deeper nesting.
