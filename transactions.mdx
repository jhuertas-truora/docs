A transaction represents a record of an action performed by a user across Truoraâ€™s products. Each transaction captures relevant information that contributes to building or updating a user profile. Transactions serve as the core data unit for decision-making, risk assessment, and user behavior analysis.

## Key Points:

### Source of Data
Transactions are generated whenever a user interacts with a Truora product or service.

### Relation to Profiles
Each transaction is linked to a user profile using identifiers (Hard ID, Soft ID, or Internal ID), ensuring that all actions are associated with the correct individual.
