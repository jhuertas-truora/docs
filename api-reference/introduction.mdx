## Core Capabilities

Our API provides four key pillars of functionality to manage your customer data:

- **Transaction Tracking:** Link transactional data, such as purchases or key events, directly to customer profiles to enrich their history.
- **Intelligent Tagging:** Apply and remove descriptive tags or labels to profiles. Use tags to categorize customers and drive segmentation logic.
- **Dynamic Segmentation:** Programmatically create and manage dynamic customer segments based on attributes, tags, and transactional behavior for targeted actions.

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

Get up and running with your first API call in minutes.

### 1. Get Your API Key
Authentication is handled via an API key sent in the request headers. You can find your key in your account's developer settings.

<Warning>
 Treat your API key like a password. Do not expose it in client-side code.

### 2. Make Your First Call
