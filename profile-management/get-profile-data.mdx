## Viewing a Customer Profile

The customer profile page provides a comprehensive, 360-degree view of an individual, consolidating their personal information, assigned tags, and a complete history of their interactions and identity verification processes.

### How to Access a Profile

To view the detailed profile of a specific customer, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Customers** section from the main menu on the left sidebar.
2.  From the customer list, click on the user you wish to view.

This will open the complete Profile page, which is organized into two main columns for clarity.

### Profile Summary Panel (Left Side)

The left column provides an at-a-glance summary of the customer's identity.

* **Client Information:** Contains the user's full name.
* **Contact Information:** Displays the user's phone number and email address. Below this, you will find the **Tags** section, which shows all the labels currently assigned to the user (e.g., "Hot", "Truorateam"). Click **Manage tags** to modify these labels.
* **Document Information:** Lists key demographic data extracted from identity documents, such as **Nationality**, **Date of birth**, and **Gender**.
* **User ID:** At the bottom, you'll find the unique system identifier for that customer. This ID is useful for internal tracking, support inquiries, and API calls.

### Activity and History Panel (Right Side)

The right column provides a detailed history of the user's activities and processes on the platform. This area is organized into tabs.

* **Identity Processes Tab:** This is the default view. It shows the results of identity verification checks.
    * **Identity Document:** Displays the images (front and back) from the most recent identity document verification transaction.
    * **Transaction History:** Provides a detailed, chronological log of all processes and checks performed for the user. Each entry includes a precise **timestamp**, the type of check (e.g., "Background check"), its **status** (e.g., "Completed"), and a unique transaction **ID**.

* **WhatsApp Conversations Tab:** This tab is available to review the history of all direct conversations with the customer through the WhatsApp channel.
