The Customer Transactions module represents the behavioral layer of our CDP. It is designed to capture, persist, and structure the chronological history of a user's interactions.

In this architecture, a "Transaction" is defined as any significant internal event generated within our ecosystem.

## Supported Transaction Types

Within our Customer Behavioral Data Model, the following internal events are classified and stored as transactions:

- **Chat Interactions:** Records of communication sessions between the user and the system (or support agents), including session start times and message exchanges.

- **Document Signatures:** Events generated when a user digitally signs a contract, agreement, or legal document within the platform.

- **Identity Validations:** Records related to Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, such as successful ID verification, facial recognition checks, or document uploads.

- **Background Checks:** Events marking the execution and completion of security, credit, or background screenings performed on the user.

- **Form Submissions:** Data points generated when a user completes and submits an internal form, such as onboarding questionnaires, surveys, or lead generation forms.

- **Tagging Events:** Transactions that assign a specific label or attribute to a user profile based on their behavior or internal logic (e.g., marking a user as "Verified" or "High Risk").

> **Note on Scope:** This model is strictly limited to internal system transactions. It does not ingest or store external third-party transaction ledgers. All recorded events originate directly from the user's interaction with Truora products and services.
