## What are Decision Variables?

Decision Variables are the result of taking each user's profile and transaction data, processing and standardizing it, and turning it into curated variables. These variables enable you to make decisions, trigger actions, automate workflows, and power hyper-personalization.

Desicion variables could be: 

- Primary: Directly tied to a transaction (e.g., phone score).
- Computed: Aggregated or derived (e.g., number of successful validations).

## Why are they important?

- **Centralize information**: consolidate scattered data into standardized, easy-to-use variables.
- **Enable fast, consistent decisions**: precomputed or automated values reduce lookup time and improve efficiency.
- **Improve personalization**: tailor products, services, or processes to each user's profile and behavior.
- **Facilitate automation**: act as direct inputs for automated flows and business rules.
- **Scale across teams**: once created, a variable can be reused by multiple teams and products, avoiding reprocessing.

## How are they selected? Key criteria

- **Decision relevance**: the variable must deliver clear value to a process, flow, or product.
- **Data availability**: the required inputs must exist and be accessible from ClickHouse.
- **Quality and consistency**: source data should be stable with no critical gaps that undermine usage.

## What use cases do they enable?

- **User experience personalization**.
- **Rules creation** (coming soon in the BRE - Business Rule Engine product, Q4 2025).
- **Flow decision optimization** (coming soon in the Flow Builder product, Q4 2025).
- **Tighter integration** with the Truora product ecosystem.
- **Rule engine inputs**, both internal and external.

<Tip>
Maintain a variable record (source, definition, owner, formula, refresh cadence) to ensure governance and reliability.
