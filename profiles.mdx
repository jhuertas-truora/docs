A profile represents the unified view of an individual user or customer. It is built by consolidating information from multiple sources and transactions across the CDP. Profiles allow you to understand who your users are, how they interact with your products, and how they evolve over time.

Profiles are not static; they continuously update as new data flows in. This ensures a real-time, comprehensive view that supports personalization, targeting, risk assessment, and analytics.

## Core concepts

- Identifiers: Keys that connect data to a profile.
- Hard IDs: Unique identifiers such as national ID or email.
- Soft IDs: Not always unique, like phone numbers.
- Internal IDs: System-level identifiers (e.g., process ID, account ID).
- Transactions: Every action a user performs in your products generates data that feeds into their profile.


## How profiles work

1. Data ingestion: Information is captured from multiple product tables or sources.
2. Event processing: Streams and parsers transform raw data into structured transactions.
3. Profile building: Transactions and decision variables are matched to existing profiles via identifiers or used to create new ones.
4. Storage: Profiles and their attributes are stored in structured tables for fast querying.
5. Continuous updates: As new events arrive, profiles are enriched in real time.

## Why profiles matter

- Single customer view: Centralize all user interactions in one place.
- Segmentation: Group users dynamically based on shared attributes or behaviors.
- Personalization: Adapt products, services, or messaging to each userâ€™s context.
- Decisioning: Use variables and rules to automate workflows or trigger actions.
- Analytics: Measure impact, evaluate risk, and optimize strategies with reliable data.
